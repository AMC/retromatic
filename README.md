# README

A small Rails app to demonstrate the use of the `hotwire`.

This app is a retro board where users can reflect on the prior sprint.

## Setup

1. `brew install sqlite3`
2. `bundle install`
3. `rails db:create db:migrate`
4. `rails s`


## Usage

1. Create a new retro board
2. Share the link with your team (or open it in multiple browsers)
3. Comment how you feel about what Went Well, Needs Improvement, or give a Shout out to a team member
4. Watch the comments appear in real-time
5. Users can upvote, edit, or delete comments
6. Users can also indicate their overall reaction using the emoji buttons. Click as many times as you like to convey exactly how you feel!


## Notes
This app was created when Hotwire first came out and may not be in compliance with current best practices.

I had been planning on making topics customizable per sprint, and ended up with a bit of a hack as a placeholder.
